This is my first programming project ever. It is a basic calculator running in the command-line. Releases can be found on the right, and source code is found above. 

## Installation

#### macOS

You can either clone the repository with git and the run `App/Main.py` with Python, or you can use the prepared shell script (described below) which will install the calculator to a specific directory and add the directory to your PATH. 

- Download and extract `Calculator-Mac.zip`
- Double-click on `Setup.tool` and follow the instructions

#### Windows

- Install Python 3
- Download and extract `Calculator-Windows.zip`
- Open terminal and navigate into the extracted zip
- Run the script with `python Pycalculator.py`
